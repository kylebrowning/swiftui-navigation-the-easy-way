# SwiftUI Navigation the Easy Way

A type-safe, scalable approach to SwiftUI navigation using enums and centralized destinations.

This is the companion project for the blog post: [SwiftUI Navigation the Easy Way](https://kylebrowning.com/posts/swiftui-navigation-the-easy-way)

## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Enum-based screen definitions with associated values
- Centralized `NavigationStack` path management
- Type-safe deep linking
- State persistence across app launches
- Tab-based navigation with independent stacks

## Part of the Landmarks Series

This project is part of a [10-part series](https://kylebrowning.com/series/landmarks-app) on building a full-stack Swift app.
